### Manage subscriptions

An Azure subscription is a logical unit for setting up a resource boundary, environment boundary, and billing boundary. Each subscription has an account attached to it that can be a work or school account, or an account Azure AD trusts. 
- You can also use a Microsoft account to use Azure since Azure AD trusts these accounts.

An Azure account is *any* identity that's part of Azure AD, or a directory trusted by Azure AD.
- Note: if you sign up for an Azure account using a work or school account, any subscription will be created in the Azure AD your work or school account is part of.
  - When using a Microsoft account (or a personal account), Azure automatically generates an Azure AD tenant during the creation of your Azure account.
