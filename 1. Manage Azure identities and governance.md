### Manage subscriptions

An Azure subscription is a logical unit for setting up a resource boundary, environment boundary, and billing boundary. Each subscription has an account attached to it that can be a work or school account, or an account Azure AD trusts. 
- You can also use a Microsoft account to use Azure since Azure AD trusts these accounts.

An Azure account is *any* identity that's part of Azure AD, or a directory trusted by Azure AD.
- Note: if you sign up for an Azure account using a work or school account, any subscription will be created in the Azure AD your work or school account is part of.
  - When using a Microsoft account (or a personal account), Azure automatically generates an Azure AD tenant during the creation of your Azure account.
 
When you create an Azure account, you become the Account Administrator. By default, the account admin will have access to the new subscription. 
- In order to grant others access, you will need to use role based access control (RBAC).
- Note: Microsoft recommends using RBAC to grant access to users and any external users to Azure resources as classic roles are not being used anymore.

Multiple subscriptions can exist within the same Azure account. Some examples of reasons you'd want multiple subscriptions include, but are not limited to:
- Project isolation
- Environment isolation

There are several methods in which you can create an Azure subscription. Some of the following options may not be available for you as specific eligibility depends on terms & conditions of each offer:
- Enterprise Agreements (EAs)
- Web Direct
