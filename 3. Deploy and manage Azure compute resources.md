# Deploy and manage Azure compute resources (20â€“25%)

## Automate deployment of resources by using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Bicep files

- Interpret an ARM template or a Bicep file
- Modify an existing ARM template
- Modify an existing Bicep file
- Deploy resources by using an ARM template or a Bicep file
- Export a deployment as an ARM template or compile a deployment as a Bicep file

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM) 

ARM provides the ability to work with the resources in your solution as a group instead of individual components. 

- Deploy, update, or delete all resources for solutions in a single operation
- Use templates for deployment
-  Templates can work for testing, staging, and production environments
-  Provides security, auditing, and tagging to assist with managing resources after deployment
- Provides the ability to monitor all resources for your solution
- Repeatedly deploy solutions throughout the development lifecycle while ensuring they're deployed consistently
- Templates are declarative and can be used to manage the infrastructure instead of using scripts
- RBAC can be applied to all service within the resource group since it's natively integrated into the management platform
- Tags can help logically organize resources within the subscription
- The organization's billing can be clarified by viewing the costs for groups of resources using the same tags
	
	
ARM provides a way to consistently manage resources by performing tasks through:

- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- The Azure portal
- REST API
- Client SDKs

Take advantage of ARM while working with solutions by:

- Defining all deployment and config steps using the template(s). No manual steps should be required to setup solutions
- Running commands like starting/stopping an app or machine to manage resources
- Organizing resources with the same lifecycle using resource groups
	- Use tags to organize additional resources

### Azure Virtual Machines

Working with VMs allows you to have more control over the installed software and configuration settings. 

Characteristics of Azure VMs include:
- Based on the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model, which is an instant computing infrastructre that's provisioned and managed over the web.
- VMs provide their own OS, storage, and networking capabilities, and can run a wide range of apps.
- VMs can be quickly scaled up and down on demand, allowing you to pay for what you use.
- Multiple VMs can be implemented, and each machine can be configured with different software and config settings to support different operations (deployment, testing, and deployment environments).
- Microsoft and the customer share responsibility associated with configuring and maintaining VMs.

Before using IaaS and VMs, you should consider the following:
- Test and development: quickly setup and tear down test & dev environments to push apps out faster. 
- Website hosting: using IaaS and VMs can make running websites less expensive than traditional hosting.
- High-performance computing (HPC): HPC can solve complex problems that involve millions of calucations or variables. VMs enable this on clusters, computer grids, or supercomputers, providing the ability to support various scenarios. 
- Storage, backup, and recovery: VMs avoid expenses associated with storage and storage management. IaaS provides a simplified approach to handling unpredictable demand, as well as backup and recovery systems.
- Extended datacenters: VMs in Azure can help add capacity to an organizations datacenter, without requiring addition cost for physical hardware and additional maintenance. 
- Big data analysis: data mining allows you to discover hidden patterns that require a large amount of processing power, provided by IaaS in a more economical approach.


### Planning VM Configuration

Following a checklist will help you plan to configure a VM:
- Network configuration: VNets are used to provide private connectivity between your VMs and other services in Azure.
	- Resources on the same VNet can access one another; by default, any resources outside the VNet aren't able to connect to those within the VNet.
   	- Additional configuration is required to the network before external services can be accessed, including any on-prem servers.
		- Note: If your organizations private network is going to be connected to the services in Azure, make sure to consider the topology before creating VMs. 

- Name for the VM: the name of the VM will be configured as part of the OS.
	- Windows VMs allow names up to 15 characters long
	- Linux VMs allow names up to 64 characters long
   		- Note: make sure to pick a naming convention that's meaningful and standardized.
       		- Ex: produsc-webvm01 would be used for the first production web server in the US South Central location.

- Location for the VM: the region in which you create your VM will be where the resources are allocated.
  	- Choosing a regional location allows your VM to be close to your users.
  		- Note: the location of the VM can improve performance and is an important decision to ensure you meet legal, tax, and/or compliance requirements.
  	 - Location can limit your options for hardware and configurations.
  	 - Location can also determine the pricing - some regions will be more expensive than others.

- Size of the VM: depending on the type of workload the VM will be running will determine the memory and storage sizes your machine will require.
  	- Azure allows you to resize VMs when the size no longer meets your needs if the hardware configuration is allowed in the new size.
  	- This provides an agile and elastic approach to VM management.
  	  	- Note: you can select any size available in your region when you stop & deallocate the VM. However, you should use caution resizing production machines as resizing might require a reboot or change the IP address, causing a temp outage.

- Review the pricing model to estimate costs: subscriptions are billed two charges for each VM; compute and storage. These costs being separate allow you to scale them and pay for only what you need.
	- Compute: paid on a per-hour basis and billed on a per-minute basis.
   		- Consumption-based means you pay for the compute capacity per second. This option allows you to increase or decrease the capcity on demand, allowing you to start or stop as needed.
   			- This option is best if your organization runs apps with unpredictable or short-term workloads that cannot be interrupted, such as quick tests or developing apps in VMs.
 		- Reserved VM Instances (RI) provides an option to purchase a VM for one or three years, in a specific region. While this option requires a commitment made up front, you save up to 72% compared to the pay-as-you-go pricing model.
     			- This option is best if the VM needs to run continuously OR if you need a predictable budget, if you can commit to using the VM for a minimum of one year.
     			- RIs can be exchanged or returned with an early term fee. 
   	- Storage: charged separately for the Azure Storage used by the VM.
   		- Status of the machine doesn't determine the charges incurred.

- Select an OS to use: pick between different versions of Windows or Linux.
  	- The cost of the OS license is included in the price.
  	- Use the Azure Marketplace to search for more than just base OS images. This allows you to install images that have the OS and additional software.
  	  	- Ex: A Linux server, Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP are included in an image stack.
  	- You can also create your own disk image if you cannot find one that suits your needs.
  	  	- Note: Azure only supports 64-bit OS.

- Identify the Azure Storage to use: Azure Managed Disks handle the storage account creation & management for you.
  	- Disk size & performance (standard or premium) can be selected.
  	- Adding disks or scaling up/down is possible. 

- Determine VM storage: all Azure VMs have *at least* two disks: an OS and a temporary disk. However, they can have one or more data disks.
  	- All disks are stored as Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs), which are like physical disks in on-prem servers, just virtualized.
  		- OS disk: every VM will have one OS disk attached.
  	   		- These disks contain the pre-installed OS and are registered as a Serial Advanced Technology Attachedment (SATA) drive.
  	  		- OS disks will be labled as the C: drive by default.
  	   	- Temp disk: data on these disks could be lost during maintenance or upon deployment, however, it should persist upon a normal reboot of the VM.
  	   	  	- Windows: by default, this drive will be labeled the D: drive and is used to store the pagefil.sys file.
  	   	  	- Linux: this drive is usually /dev/sdb and is formatted & mounted to /mnt by the Azure Linux Agent.
				- Important: data on the temp drive should not be critical to the system as it could be lost upon moving to a new host.
  	   	- Data disks: these are managed disks and used to store app data, or any other data that's needed to be kept.
  	   	  	- Registered as SCSI drives and are able to be labeled a letter of your choice.
  	   	  	  	- Note: the size of the VM determines how many data disks can be attached and the kind of storage that can be used to host these disks.
  	   	  	 
### Storage considerations

- Azure Premium Storage: gain high-performance, low-latency disk support for VMs with input/output (I/O)-intensive workloads.
  	- Premium Storage stored data on SSDs.
  	- Existing VM disks can be migrated to Premium Storage.

- Multiple Storage disks: using multiple disks allows your apps up to 256 TB of storage space per VM.
  	- Premium Storage allows your apps to achieve 80,000 I/O operations per second (IOPS) per VM & a disk throughput up to 2,000 MB/s per VM.
  	- Read operations yield low latencies with Premium Storage.

- Managed disks: Azure Managed Disks are VHDs and are stored as page blobs which are a random IO storage object.
  	- These disks are considered *managed* because they are an abstraction over page blobs, blob containers, and Azure storage accounts.
  	- You provision these disks while Azure handles creating and managing them.
  	- These types of disks are available in Ultra SSD, Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard HDD.
  	  	- Note: These disks are required for the single instance VM SLA.
  	 
- Migrating to Premium Storage: Microsoft recommends migrating VM disks that require high IOPS to Premium Storage for the best performance.
	- If the disk doesn't require high IOPS, reduce your cost by keeping it in standard storage.


### Creating VMs in Azure portal

The first thing to decide is which image to use while creating a VM in the Azure portal. The portal will guide you through the config process while creating the machine image.

- Basics tab: contains the admin account, project details, and inbound port rules.
- Disks tab: select the OS disk type & data disks.
- Networking tab: create VNets and load balancing.
- Management tab: enable auto-shutdown and configure backup details.
- Advanced tab: configure scripts, agents, or VM extensions.
- Monitoring & Tabs tabs: additional settings are available.

### Connecting to VMs

You can connect to your VMs in Azure in multiple ways:
- Azure Bastion
- SSH
- RDP
- Cloud Shell


### Windows-based VMs

Connecting to a Windows VM hosted in Azure will be done using the Remote Desktop app (uses RDP). 
- Any version of Windows that's supported will have a GUI session.
	- The VMs IP address and port number will be needed to connect with this method. Azure will then allow you to download a RDP file to use to connect.

### Linux-based VMs

Connecting to a Linux VM hosted in Azure can be done using an SSH client. 
- You can reuse a single public-private key pair to access VMs and services, depending on the org's security policies.
	- WSL, Terminal, or Shell can be used as SSH clients to connect.
   	- The path to your private key file will be required. This key remains on your system and needs to be protected. 
   	- The public key will be placed on the Linux VM, or another service using public-key cryptography.

### Azure Bastion

Note: this is a platform managed PaaS service.

Bastion provides secure, seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to all VMs in the VNet, directly over SSL. 
- No IP address is required when connecting using the service.
- Azure Bastion protects VMs from exposing RDP/SSH ports externally.
	- Note: this service allows you to connect directly from Azure portal; no additional software is required.
