# Deploy and manage Azure compute resources (20â€“25%)

## Automate deployment of resources by using templates

- Modify an ARM template
- Deploy a template
- Save a deployment as an ARM template
- Deploy virtual machine (VM) extensions

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM) 

ARM provides the ability to work with the resources in your solution as a group instead of individual components. 

- Deploy, update, or delete all resources for solutions in a single operation
- Use templates for deployment
-  Templates can work for testing, staging, and production environments
-  Provides security, auditing, and tagging to assist with managing resources after deployment
	- Provides the ability to monitor all resources for your solution
	- Repeatedly deploy solutions throughout the development lifecycle while ensuring they're deployed consistently
	- Templates are declarative and can be used to manage the infrastructure instead of using scripts
	- RBAC can be applied to all service within the resource group since it's natively integrated into the management platform
	- Tags can help logically organize resources within the subscription
	- The organization's billing can be clarified by viewing the costs for groups of resources using the same tags
	
	
ARM provides a way to consistently manage resources by performing tasks through:

- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- The Azure portal
- REST API
- Client SDKs
