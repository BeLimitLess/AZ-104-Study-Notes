# Deploy and manage Azure compute resources (20â€“25%)

## Automate deployment of resources by using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Bicep files

- Interpret an ARM template or a Bicep file
- Modify an existing ARM template
- Modify an existing Bicep file
- Deploy resources by using an ARM template or a Bicep file
- Export a deployment as an ARM template or compile a deployment as a Bicep file

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM) 

ARM provides the ability to work with the resources in your solution as a group instead of individual components. 

- Deploy, update, or delete all resources for solutions in a single operation
- Use templates for deployment
-  Templates can work for testing, staging, and production environments
-  Provides security, auditing, and tagging to assist with managing resources after deployment
- Provides the ability to monitor all resources for your solution
- Repeatedly deploy solutions throughout the development lifecycle while ensuring they're deployed consistently
- Templates are declarative and can be used to manage the infrastructure instead of using scripts
- RBAC can be applied to all service within the resource group since it's natively integrated into the management platform
- Tags can help logically organize resources within the subscription
- The organization's billing can be clarified by viewing the costs for groups of resources using the same tags
	
	
ARM provides a way to consistently manage resources by performing tasks through:

- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- The Azure portal
- REST API
- Client SDKs

Take advantage of ARM while working with solutions by:

- Defining all deployment and config steps using the template(s). No manual steps should be required to setup solutions
- Running commands like starting/stopping an app or machine to manage resources
- Organizing resources with the same lifecycle using resource groups
	- Use tags to organize additional resources



## Create and configure virtual machines

- Create a virtual machine
- Configure Azure Disk Encryption
- Move a virtual machine to another resource group, subscription, or region
- Manage virtual machine sizes
- Manage virtual machine disks
- Deploy virtual machines to availability zones and availability sets
- Deploy and configure an Azure Virtual Machine Scale SetsCreate a VM
- Manage images by using the Azure Compute Gallery


### Azure Virtual Machines

Working with VMs allows you to have more control over the installed software and configuration settings. 

Characteristics of Azure VMs include:
- Based on the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model, which is an instant computing infrastructre that's provisioned and managed over the web.
- VMs provide their own OS, storage, and networking capabilities, and can run a wide range of apps.
- VMs can be quickly scaled up and down on demand, allowing you to pay for what you use.
- Multiple VMs can be implemented, and each machine can be configured with different software and config settings to support different operations (deployment, testing, and deployment environments).
- Microsoft and the customer share responsibility associated with configuring and maintaining VMs.

Before using IaaS and VMs, you should consider the following:
- Test and development: quickly setup and tear down test & dev environments to push apps out faster. 
- Website hosting: using IaaS and VMs can make running websites less expensive than traditional hosting.
- High-performance computing (HPC): HPC can solve complex problems that involve millions of calucations or variables. VMs enable this on clusters, computer grids, or supercomputers, providing the ability to support various scenarios. 
- Storage, backup, and recovery: VMs avoid expenses associated with storage and storage management. IaaS provides a simplified approach to handling unpredictable demand, as well as backup and recovery systems.
- Extended datacenters: VMs in Azure can help add capacity to an organizations datacenter, without requiring addition cost for physical hardware and additional maintenance. 
- Big data analysis: data mining allows you to discover hidden patterns that require a large amount of processing power, provided by IaaS in a more economical approach.

## Provision and manage containers in the Azure portal

- Create and manage an Azure container registry
- Provision a container by using Azure Container Instances
- Provision a container by using Azure Container Apps
- Manage sizing and scaling for containers, including Azure Container Instances and Azure Container AppsConfigure sizing and scaling for Azure Container Instances


## Create and configure an Azure App Service

- Provision an App Service plan
- Configure scaling for an App Service plan
- Create an App Service
- Configure certificates and TLS for an App Service
- Map an existing custom DNS name to an App Service
- Configure backup for an App Service
- Configure networking settings for an App Service
- Configure deployment slots for an App Service
