- Can be used in two modes, either locally, or in the cloud:

    - Scripting: execute a script containing multiple commands.
- Commands are structured in groups and subgroups.
    - Groups represent Azure services.
    - Subgroups divide commands into logical groupings for each service.

## Azure Regions 

A region is a geographical area comprising at least one datacenter, but usually multiple. Datacenters are isolated from each other in close proximity & combined nnected via low-latency networks to enable fsster and seamless communication. 

- Regions offer compliance & resilency options. 
- Regions offer the flexibility to deploy resources to regions that are close to an organization's customers. 
- Regions ensure data residency. 
- Some services are region specific or limited to some regions upon launching. 
- Upon deploying resources in Azure, you will be asked to select a region in most cases. 
- Azure AD, Traffic Manager, and DNS don't need a region. the region will show as Global. 
- Regions are paired with another region in the same geography to create "regional pairs."

An Azure geography is an area that consists of one or more Azure regions. 

Examples include, but are not limited to:

- The US: consists of several regions; East US, Central US, West US, etc. 
- India
- The UK
