### Availability sets

An availability set is a logical grouping of virtual machines hosting your application. These consist of update domains (UDs) and fault domains (FDs). Each VM you create will have a UD and FD that's associated with it. 
- Note: you can have up to 3 FDs and 20 UDs.
  - The default number of UDs is 5. If you create more than 5 VMs, the 6th VM will be placed on the 1st UD, the 7th on the 2nd UD, and so on.

Deploying multiple instances of your app will help you achieve High Availability (HA), which removes the risk of a single point of failure.
