### Immutable Storage - Blob Storage

Immutable storage for Blob Storage allows users to store business-critical data in a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) state.
- While in this state, data cannot be modified or deleted for a user specified time.
  - Important: Immutability policies protects your data from overwrites and deletes.
 
There are two types of immutability policies:
- Time-based retention policies: policies are set to store data for a specific timeframe.
  - Data can be created and read, but cannot be edited or deleted.
  - When the retention period expires, objects can be deleted but **cannot** be overwritten.
- Legal hold policies: these store the data until the legal hold is explicitly cleared.

Note: there is **no** additional cost for using immutable storage as the data is priced the same as mutable data.
